# Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dimitri, a french software engineer since 2014 and a father of one son since 2022.  
I'm working at Agicap as an employee on a 4/5 basis and spend the rest of the time working with Ytreza.dev collective as a freelancer.

## Emotional numbness

Let's start kick-off by telling you I'm pretty dull in term of emotion. The good thing is, you can't make me mad or sad for that matter. The not so good one, is that I struggle quite a bit with human behavior. I can conceive a lot of thing but can only understand few regarding the human being. This is a big WIP of my life and it's pretty enjoyable in fact because I seek for everything I know I don't know.

## I care about

### Building good quality product

Like almost everyone, I started my career reading requirements specifications, as long as an encyclopedia and signed by many so that everyone can cover their ass if things go sideways.
While this process was of no fun, I enjoyed writing "quality" code, at least with the definition I had at that time.
Too bad we worked for years running on investors' money and having barely one customer. Sounds familiar, right?

Not so long after, I learned about Clean Code, Clean Architecture and TDD. On the technical aspect, I began to understand of how quality softwares should be built, that is to say, with very high maintainability in mind.
A good thing for sure, but it won't solve the lack of customer part. If you have none, what purpose serves the software? Can we call it "software" then? To what change should it adapt to? And who asks for this change to occur? And why? Remember, there is no customer, so no feedback to drive this change.

During this journey, connections were made here and there. First, reading DDD introduced me to a deep understanding of the domain and the problem we aim to solve. 
Then learning about No-Estimate made total sense to me. It's by doing the thing that you know the time it takes. Dead simple.
The next big step was the discovery of Lean Startup and that is when things got difficult, in a nice way. Everything connects. The feedback loop is the key. We need to build around the greatest one we can come up with.

This is where I am now, trying everything I can to reduce this damn feedback loop with my team. 

### Social impact

I trust everyone to act of kindness by default. Like Socrates, I believe that only the lack of knowledge can decide otherwise.
With that in mind,  


### environmental impact

  - That is
